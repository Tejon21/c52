    <p>Hello, my name is Teanna Jones, I was born in chicago and grew up in Chicago and Milwaukee.<br> I have 2 sisters and
        1 brother, we were raised by our mother and majority of her side of the family.<br> I love video games since I was
        young playing them with my brother, this love brought me to my dream of creating a game and joining I.C.Stars.

        This video does not support HTML5
    </video>
    <p style="color: gray">This video inspires and motivates me because <b>I have never lived on my own nor owned a
            home</b>. <br>I want my starter home to be a tiny home to which I can customize however I like.<br> To see someone
        who looks like me and has her tiny home.<br> She also is an entrepreneur, I also want to own my own business, this motivates me to continue on my goal.</p>

        This video does not support HTML5
    </video>
    <p style="color:blueviolet">This video inspires and motivates me in a different way.<br> I love gaming <i>(role play and
            simulation games mostly)</i>, watching videos like this one gives me ideas on my own game play.<br> I use this also as research on
        the development of my game and thoughts on whether I too should create a youtube channel.</p>

    <section style="color:azure">
        <h2 id="til">Things I have learned at I.C.Stars so far:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>That everyone is similar but different in this cohort: from personality, to background, and aspirations.
        </li>
        <li>I really need to speak up more in a sense when asking questions.</li>
        <li>Coding in HTML through various forms like: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a
                href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/">PluralSight</a> among others.</li>
        <li>Tea time: never had it before and might implement it when I create my own business.</li>
        <li>To value time, practice doesn't mean perfect but better, and that it is okay to let others in because you
            will walk away with more knowledge and understanding.</li>
    </ul>
